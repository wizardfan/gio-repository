	    The proteomics data can come in various formats, including but not limited to PSI standards (mzQuantML and mzIdentML) and widely-used TSV(tab-separated-value) formats which is used by MaxQuant. This tools converts the information in different formats to a fixed-header tsv which will be used in the PIT:Integrate tool. The headers are in the order of Peptide, Protein, Reverse, Contamination, Score, Quantitation and unlimited optional columns. Of course it can be used standard-alone to extract the essential information from those more-complex formats.
