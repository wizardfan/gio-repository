*Name:* MS/MS Search<br>
*Description:*<br>

		Using SearchGUI to perform MS/MS search via X!Tandem, OMSSA and MS-GF+
	<br>
*Input files:*
  * spectra   Input Peak Lists (mgf) Select appropriate MGF dataset(s) from history
*Parameters:*<br>
  * Conditional element: database
    * built_in
    * upload

  * precursor_ion_tol   Percursor Ion Tolerance Provide error value for precursor ion, based on instrument used. 10 ppm recommended for Orbitrap instrument
  * precursor_ion_tol_units   Precursor Ion Tolerance Units Select based on instrument used, as different machines provide different quality of spectra. ppm is a standard for most precursor ions
  * enzyme   Enzyme Which enzyme was used for protein digest in experiment? In most cases, trypsin is used
  * missed_cleavages   Maximum Missed Cleavages Allow peptides to contain up to this many missed enzyme cleavage sites. 2 is the recommended value
  * fixed_modifications   Fixed Modifications Occurs in known places on peptide sequence. Hold the appropriate key while clicking to select multiple items
  * variable_modifications   Variable Modifications Can occur anywhere on the peptide sequence; adds additional error to search score. Hold the appropriate key while clicking to select multiple items
  * min_charge   Minimum Charge Lowest searched charge value for fragment ions
  * max_charge   Maximum Charge Highest searched charge value for fragment ions
  * omssa   Run OMSSA 
  * tandem   Run X!Tandem 
  * msgf   Run MS-GF+ 
*Outputs:*<br>
  * output with Type html
*Details:*<br>
**What it does**

Runs multiple search engines (X!Tandem, OMSSA and MS-GF+) on any number of MGF peak lists using the SearchGUI application. All result files are automatically converted to the PSI standard format mzIdentML
