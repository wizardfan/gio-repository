*Name:* mzIdLib:Merge<br>
*Description:*<br>
Using mzIdentML-Lib to combine mzIdentML result files from different search engines<br>
*Input files:*
  * input1   First Input mzIdentML file 
  * input2   Second Input mzIdentML file 
*Parameters:*<br>
  * cv1   CV term for FDR calculation in the first mzIdentML file 
  * cv2   CV term for FDR calculation in the second mzIdentML file 
  * Conditional element: third
    * 1
    * 0

  * decoyRegex    
  * decoyValue    
*Outputs:*<br>
  * output with Type mzid
*Details:*<br>
	Using mzidLib (https://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-lib/) to combine mzIdentML files from no more than three search engines from the same spectral file into single mzIdentmL file for further processing. 
    NOTE: This tool internally calls FalseDiscoveryRate in the first (individual search engines) and second pass analysis (combinations of search engines identifying the same PSM). The algorithm REQUIRES a concatenated target:decoy search and will fail if it doesn’t detect a suitable amount of decoys. This also means that the search with individual each search engine needs to export sufficiently weak IDs that there are lots of decoys.
