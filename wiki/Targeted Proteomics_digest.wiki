*Name:* Digest<br>
*Description:*<br>
Theoretically digest all protein sequences from a FASTA file by trypsin<br>
*Input files:*
  * input   Input file 
*Parameters:*<br>
  * minLength   the minimum length for the digested peptides to be included in the result file 
  * maxLength   the maximum length for the digested peptides to be included in the result file 
  * unique   Only keeps proteotypic peptides? 
*Outputs:*<br>
  * output with Type fasta
*Details:*<br>
	     This tool digests protein sequences passed to in FASTA format and outputs the results of this digest as individual entries in a new FASTA file where the entries are named <protein>-pep<peptide_number>.  The additional filters for peptide length and proteotypic peptides are useful for SRM (Selected Reaction Monitoring) to filter out the peptides won't be observed on a specific MS/MS instrument.
