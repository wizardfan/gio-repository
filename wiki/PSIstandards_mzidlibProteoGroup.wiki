*Details:*<br>
	ProteoGrouper performs sequence-based protein inference, based on a set of PSMs. It should be parameterized with the CV accession for the PSM score used to create a protein score. The tool also needs to know whether the score should be log transformed (true for e/p-values etc.) to create a positive protein score.
