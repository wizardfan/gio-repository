*Details:*<br>
	Proteomics Informed by Transcriptomics (PIT) provides the advantage over traditional proteomics methods (http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n12/abs/nmeth.2227.html). This tool is the core of PIT, which combines the proteomics and transcriptomics data by id mapping using the pre-defined regular expression. It generates three output files: the gff3 file, the SAM file which is the original SAM file from GMAP plus the annotation of proteomics data, and the longest ORF fasta files.
